Cambridge University
<!--more-->
The beautiful streets of Cambridge full with buildings and houses from the 16th-18th century. It has small roads and passes.<!--more-->
One of the Top places to visit is the University of Cambridge. Which I think founded around 1209 and considered as "ancient university" together with the Oxford University and are often jointly referred to as "[Oxbridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxbridge)". As an institution with such a long history, the University has developed a large number of myths and legends. Some of the myths we discovered in the Backs Gondola Tour which was very romantic and relaxing thing to do.

The tour cost us around 40GBP per Gandola and we were a group of 6 so we shared between us. You also can join a group of people and it will probably cost you around 10GBP per person. The guy from the Gandola tour was very friendly and I am not sure if this is true but he told us that all who graduate successfully from the University jumps from the famous Bridge.
