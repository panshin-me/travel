## 1Edinburgh

**Tips:** It is nice city, however I think half or one day enough to explorer all the interesting points of the city.

### 2Edinburgh Castle


  
starstarstarstarstar

Edinburgh Castle is a historic fortress which dominates the skyline of the city of Edinburgh, Scotland from its position on the Castle Rock. Archaeologists have established human occupation of the rock since at least the Iron Age (2nd century AD), although the nature of the early settlement is unclear. There has been a royal castle on the rock since at least the reign of David I in the 12th century, and the site continued to be a royal residence until the Union of the Crowns in 1603. From the 15th century the castle&#8217;s residential role declined, and by the 17th century, it was principally used as military barracks with a large garrison. Its importance as a part of Scotland&#8217;s national heritage was recognised increasingly from the early 19th century onwards, and various restoration programmes have been carried out over the past century and a half. As one of the most important strongholds in the Kingdom of Scotland, Edinburgh Castle was involved in many historical conflicts from the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century to the Jacobite Rising of 1745. It has been besieged, both successfully and unsuccessfully, on several occasions.

### 3Holyrood Park


  
starstarstarstarstar

Holyrood Park is a royal park in central Edinburgh, Scotland about a mile to the east of Edinburgh Castle. It has an array of hills, lochs, glens, ridges, basalt cliffs, and patches of whin (gorse) providing a remarkably wild piece of highland landscape within its 650-acre (260 ha) area. The park is associated with the royal palace of Holyroodhouse and was formerly a 12th-century royal hunting estate. The park was created in 1541 when James V had the ground &#8220;circulit about Arthurs Sett, Salisborie and Duddingston craggis&#8221; enclosed by a stone wall.[1] Holyrood Park is now publicly accessible. Arthur&#8217;s Seat, the highest point in Edinburgh, is at the centre of the park, with the cliffs of Salisbury Crags to the west. There are three lochs; St Margaret&#8217;s Loch, Dunsapie Loch, and Duddingston Loch. The ruined St Anthony&#8217;s Chapel stands above St Margaret&#8217;s Loch. Queen&#8217;s Drive is the main route through the Park and is partly closed on Sundays to motor vehicles.[2] St Margaret&#8217;s Well and St Anthony&#8217;s Well are both natural springs within the park. Holyrood Park is located to the south-east of the Old Town, at the edge of the city centre. Abbeyhill is to the north and Duddingston village to the east. The University of Edinburgh&#8217;s Pollock Halls of Residence are to the south-west, and Dumbiedykes is to the west.

### 4The Royal Mile (street)


  
starstarstarstarstar

The Royal Mile is the name given to a succession of streets forming the main thoroughfare of the Old Town of the city of Edinburgh in Scotland. The name was first used in W M Gilbert&#8217;s Edinburgh in the Nineteenth Century (1901) and was further popularised as the title of a guidebook, published in 1920.

**Tips:** There lot of street performances on the street. Most of performances are advertisings for local theatres. I think this is must visit Edinburg attraction. You can see one of the street performances on a clip beginning on the down of the page.

### 5Lanark medieval festival

### 10Track: Old Man of Storr


  
starstarstarstarstar

This is properly the most famous walk on the Island and definitely the busiest. The â€˜Old Manâ€™ is a large pinnacle of rock that stands high and can be seen for miles around. As part of the Trotternish ridge the Storr was created by a massive ancient landside, leaving one of the most photographed landscapes in the world.
