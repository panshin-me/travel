<p>� Bellagio Hotel</p>

<p>Address: 3600 Las Vegas Blvd. South, Las Vegas Priority:  When Steve Wynn created the Bellagio his intention was to create the most luxurious hotel on the planet. He did not fall far from his mark, from the marble floors to the huge skylights and the extensive gardens you forget you’re in Las Vegas. If you include the world class dining experiences and the Cirque du Soliel “O” show you realize you might not care about the rooms. Actually, they are incredible. Bellagio is about opulence and the rooms are roomy, tasteful and a little slice of heaven. All at a price, the Bellagio is one of the most expensive hotels in Las Vegas.
