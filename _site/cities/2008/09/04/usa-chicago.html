<p>Navy Pier</p>

<p>Address: 600 E Grand Ave, Chicago, IL</p>

<p>Priority:  Located on Lake Michigan, just East of Chicago’s Downtown, Navy Pier has been a Chicago landmark since it first opened in 1916. Originally designed as both a shipping and recreational facility, the Pier also served as a military training site during two world wars, a venue for concerts and exhibitions, and the temporary home for a once-fledgling University of Illinois’ Chicago campus. As the Pier fell into disuse during much of the 1970s and 1980s, the State of Illinois and Chicago embarked on a joint plan whereby, in 1989, ownership of the Pier was transferred to the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority, the same body which oversees Chicago’s McCormick Place. The Authority moved swiftly to redesign Navy Pier into one of the country’s most unique recreation and exposition facilities. Navy Pier now showcases a unique collection of restaurants and shops in addition to unequaled recreational and exhibition facilities – in a setting like no other.</p>

<p>how to fix split ends</p>

<p>Grant Park</p>

<p>Address: 201 E Randolph St, Chicago, IL</p>

<p>Priority:  After the Great Fire of 1871, much of the debris was pushed into the lake, creating the fill for what is now the actual park. At the end of the 19th century, plans were made to develop the park and construct large buildings and commercial property in the park. But a Chicagoan citizen, A. Montgomery Ward, wanted the park to remain open space as had already been decided in 1836, and brought the plans to court. After almost 20 years of battle in court, he won the case in 1911. As a result, the park remains open space, offering a great view on the cliff of buildings on Michigan Avenue.</p>
